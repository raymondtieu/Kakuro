# Kakuro
Kakuro as a CSP

After downloading all the files, using Python 3.5.2, 
Open up test_cases.py in IDLE or run it in your favourite IDE.

At the bottom of the file you'll see

```
##RUN TEST CASES     
if __name__=="__main__":
    test_5x5_boards(kakuro_csp_model)
    test_9x8_boards(kakuro_csp_model)
    # test_13x13_boards(kakuro_csp_model)
    # test_15x15_boards(kakuro_csp_model)
    # test_15x30_boards(kakuro_csp_model)
```
    
To test each component, simply uncomment/comment (adding/removing # from the lines) and run the file.
You should see the results along with each test being ran.
